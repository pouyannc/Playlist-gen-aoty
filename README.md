# AOTY Playlist generator (1.2.1)

Generate playlists compiled from the most talked about albums over at aoty.org.

Go here to use the app: https://aoty-playlist-gen-2a2168969963.herokuapp.com/  

Customize your playlist through several options such as genre, track length, and album diversity. A preview of each playlist type is given. Logging in using Spotify is disabled until a Quota Extension is approved. Generated playlists are linked and can be added to your library.

Future additions: 
- Login to Spotify and directly create playlist on your account
- Generate list based on time periods (decades)
- Undo playlist

1.2.1: Bug fix for recent months tab.

1.2: Ability to use the app without a Spotify login. Requires user to add the generated playlist to their Spotify library if they want to keep it. Removed logging in with Spotify due to the app not yet being in extended quote mode.

1.1: Refactor to optimize performance by handling some operations through Spotify API requests instead of scrapes.
